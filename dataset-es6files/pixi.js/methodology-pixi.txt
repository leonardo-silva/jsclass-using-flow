1- Create the flow files (src+tests) for each class. Ex: DisplayObject-flow.js, Bounds-flow.js, etc
2- Add the specific test code to the end of each generated file. 
3- Verify if the variable names created in the require statements are equal to the class names. If equal, just comment the require statement line. If not, the variable must be assigned to the value exported by the file indicated in the require statement (the parameter).
4- Remove the 'export default' before the definition of the imported classes (classes copied from other files).
5- Check manually every dependency in the test file. The file index.js imports the whole src folder at once inside a variable PIXI. Then, to use the class Bounds, for example, one has to call PIXI.Bounds. So, I have to copy the defition of the used classes and erase the prefix PIXI wherever it appears.
6- We import the definitions of every import command, even when the imported files do not cointain classes. Ex: const.js

OBS: During the analysis of a class A, if it imports class B and class B imports another class C, its not necessary to copy the definition of class C inside the file that implements A, unless there is an inheritance relationship between B and C. 

* Example of command used to generate the .dump files using Flow: "flow dump-types --strip-root CanvasRenderer-flow.js > CanvasRenderer-flow.dump"

* Some class files do not import other classes, eg. CanvasMaskManager. In this case, I am not creating the dump file.

* Example of association in class Graphics:
        const data = new GraphicsData(
            this.lineWidth,
            this.lineColor,
            this.lineAlpha,
            this.fillColor,
            this.fillAlpha,
            this.filling,
            shape
        );

        this.graphicsData.push(data);
The field graphicsData is an array of type GraphicsData, and this is considered one association.		

* Exemple of dependency with more than one class in one same reference (multiple type).
Graphics-flow.js:5324:13-17: Circle | Ellipse | Polygon | Rectangle | RoundedRectangle

* Inside AccessibilityManager.js, we have an import of multiple files using '*':
import * as core from '../core';
In this case, to know which classes from '../core' are been used, we have to 
1) look for the prefix 'core', like in:
core.WebGLRenderer.registerPlugin('accessibility', AccessibilityManager);
core.CanvasRenderer.registerPlugin('accessibility', AccessibilityManager);
2) Import the classes 
3) Eliminate the prefix, like in:
WebGLRenderer.registerPlugin('accessibility', AccessibilityManager);
CanvasRenderer.registerPlugin('accessibility', AccessibilityManager);

* The following case, inside BitmapText.js, represents an association:
                c = new Sprite(chars[i].texture);
                this._glyphs.push(c);

* We have a problem with extra features (i.e. features added at runtime) because we do not evaluate its dependencies. Ex: class DisplayObject is "extended" in file cacheAsBitmap.js (CacheData-flow.js).

* we have some "private" function, like 'function uploadBaseTextures(prepare, item)' in file CanvasPrepare.js, which are implemented outside the body of the class only not to be exported to other files, meaning that they are private. In this study, we are considering the source could of these functions when looking for dependencies, because they are part of the class implementation.
